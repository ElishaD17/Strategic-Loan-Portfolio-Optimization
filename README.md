# Bank Loan Analysis Project

## Overview
This project involves analyzing bank loan data using SQL queries executed in SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS) and visualizing the results in Tableau. The primary goal is to derive insights from the loan data to improve decision-making processes.

## Software Used
- **MS Office/Excel** 
- **MS SQL Server** 
- **SQL Server Management Studio**
- **Tableau** 

## Project Structure
The project consists of running SQL queries to extract relevant data from the bank loan database and then visualizing this data using Tableau. The analysis is divided into three main dashboards, each serving a specific purpose:

1. **Dashboard 1: Summary**
2. **Dashboard 2: Overview**
3. **Dashboard 3: Details**

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) and Charts
### Dashboard 1: Summary
- **Total Loan Applications**: Calculating the total number of loan applications.
- **Total Funded Amount**: Understanding the total funds disbursed as loans.
- **Total Amount Received**: Tracking the total amount received from borrowers.
- **Average Interest Rate**: Calculating the average interest rate across all loans.
- **Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI)**: Evaluating the average DTI for borrowers.

### Dashboard 2: Overview
- **Monthly Trends by Issue Date**: Line chart to identify seasonality and long-term trends.
- **Regional Analysis by State**: Filled map to identify regions with significant lending activity.
- **Loan Term Analysis**: Donut chart to understand the distribution of loans across various terms.
- **Employee Length Analysis**: Bar chart to assess the impact of employment history on loan applications.
- **Loan Purpose Breakdown**: Bar chart to provide a visual breakdown of loan metrics based on the stated purposes.
- **Home Ownership Analysis**: Tree map to show how home ownership impacts loan applications.

### Dashboard 3: Details
- **Comprehensive Details Dashboard**: Provides a consolidated view of all essential information within the loan data, offering a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics.

## Visualizations in Tableau
The results from the above SQL queries were used to create various visualizations in Tableau. The dashboards provide an intuitive view of the loan data, making it easier to derive insights.

### Sample Visualizations
- **Total Loan Applications by Month**
- **Total Funded Amount by State**
- **Loan Term Analysis (Donut Chart)**
- **Employee Length Analysis (Bar Chart)**
- **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart)**
- **Home Ownership Analysis (Tree Map)**

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates the effective use of SQL for data extraction and Tableau for data visualization. The insights derived from the analysis can help improve decision-making processes in loan management and policy formulation.
